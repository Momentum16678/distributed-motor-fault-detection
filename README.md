## Project Description
This repository contains the MATLAB code for detecting bearing, rotor bar, and stator faults in industrial motors using distributed processing architecture.

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018a or later
- Simulink
- Simscape Electrical Toolbox

## File Structure
- `main_simulation.m` - Main simulation script
- `fault_injection/` - Fault simulation functions
- `signal_processing/` - Wavelet and envelope detection algorithms
- `distributed_system/` - Distributed processing implementation

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run `main_simulation.m`

## Results
- 97% detection accuracy
- 99.99% data reduction
- 50ms response time
